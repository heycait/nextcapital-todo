# NextCapital Todo List Challenge

A todo list webapp that integrates with the RESTful JSON API provided by NextCapital (http://recruiting-api.nextcapital.com). Built on top of Angular, jQuery/AJAX, and jQueryUI.

Source code: https://github.com/heycait/heycait.github.io/tree/master/nextcapital-todo
Deployed: http://caitlyncodes.com/nextcapital-todo/

Note: This is my first time using Angular and working on just the client-side (as opposed to using the View provided in a Rails app). Therefore the Angular parts of it may not be conventional/proper.
