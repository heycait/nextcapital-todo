# NextCapital Todo List Challenge

A todo list webapp that integrates with the RESTful JSON API provided by NextCapital (http://recruiting-api.nextcapital.com). Built on top of Angular, jQuery/AJAX, and jQueryUI.

Source code: https://github.com/heycait/heycait.github.io/tree/master/nextcapital-todo

Deployed: http://caitlyncodes.com/nextcapital-todo/

NOTE: This is my first time using Angular and working on just the client-side as opposed to using the View provided in a Rails app. Therefore the Angular parts of it may not be conventional/proper. And since I didn't use the Angular seed, I didn't have an associated web server and could not deploy to Heroku (thus my decision to host it on my GitHub page). I used the Python SimpleHTTPServer in development. Could eventually add a Node server or migrate over to Firebase.
